# Web Scraping ESPN Cricinfo - Bowling Records

This project automates the extraction of international cricket bowling records from the ESPN Cricinfo website. Using Selenium (with undetected-chromedriver), it navigates through various statistical categories, scrapes paginated data tables, and saves the results in CSV format for further analysis.

## Features

- Scrapes more than 10 distinct bowling record tables (e.g., Most wickets, Best figures, Fastest to 100 wickets, etc.)
- Automated navigation and pagination handling for multi-page records
- Robust header and data extraction logic to handle dynamic table structures
- Saves each category as a separate CSV file in an output directory
- Handles Chrome driver stealth and modern anti-scraping measures

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Google Chrome (compatible version)
- [undetected-chromedriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver)
- [selenium](https://selenium.dev/)
- pandas

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install undetected-chromedriver selenium pandas
```

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SaiKiran3640/Web-Scraping-ESPN-Cricinfo.git
    cd Web-Scraping-ESPN-Cricinfo
    ```

2. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python bowling.py
    ```

3. **Output:**
    - CSV files for each bowling record category will be saved to the `espncricinfo_bowling_records/` directory.

## How It Works

- The script defines a dictionary of bowling record categories and their corresponding ESPN Cricinfo URL slugs.
- For each category, it navigates to the records page, waits for the table to load, and extracts both header and data rows.
- If the table spans multiple pages, it clicks through all pages and aggregates the data.
- Each table is saved as a CSV file, with headers cleaned and data deduplicated.

## Categories Scraped

Examples of scraped categories include:

- Most wickets in career
- Best figures in an innings
- Best figures in a match
- Most wickets in a calendar year
- Most wickets in a series
- Best career bowling average
- Best career strike rate
- Fastest to 100/200/300/400/500/600/700 wickets

(See `bowling.py` â†’ `RECORD_CATEGORIES` for the full list.)

## Notes

- Make sure your Chrome browser is installed and up-to-date.
- For headless operation, uncomment the relevant line in `setup_driver()`.
- ESPN Cricinfo may update their site structure; in case of scraping issues, review and adjust the table selectors in the script.
